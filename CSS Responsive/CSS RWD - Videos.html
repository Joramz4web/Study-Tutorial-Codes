    <h1>Responsive Web Design - Videos</h1>
    <h2>Using The width Property</h2>
    
    <p>If the width property is set to 100%, the video player will be responsive and scale up and down:</p>

    <!--Example
video {
  width: 100%;
  height: auto;
}-->

    <p>Notice that in the example above, the video player can be scaled up to be larger than its original size. A better solution, in many cases, will be to use the max-width property instead.</p>

    <h2>Using The max-width Property</h2>
    <p>If the max-width property is set to 100%, the video player will scale down if it has to, but never scale up to be larger than its original size:</p>

    <!--Example
video {
  max-width: 100%;
  height: auto;
}-->

    <h2>Add a Video to the Example Web Page</h2>
    <p>We want to add a video in our example web page. The video will be resized to always take up all the available space:</p>

    <!--Example
video {
  width: 100%;
  height: auto;
}s-->
