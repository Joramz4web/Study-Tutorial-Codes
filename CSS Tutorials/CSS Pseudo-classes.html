    <h1>CSS Pseudo-classes</h1>
    <p>A CSS pseudo-class is a keyword that can be added to a selector, to define a style for a special state of an element.</p>
    <p>Some common use for pseudo-classes:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Style an element when a user moves the mouse over it</li>
        <li>Style visited and unvisited links differently</li>
        <li>Style an element when it gets focus</li>
        <li>Style valid/invalid/required/optional form elements</li>
        <li>Style an element that is the first child of its parent</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Syntax: Pseudo-classes are always denoted by a single colon (:) followed by the pseudo-class name:
        selector:pseudo-class-name {<br>
            CSS properties<br>
            }</p>
    <p>Here we use the :hover pseudo-class and the :focus pseudo-class:</p>

    <h2>Pseudo-classes Used on Links</h2>
    <p>For HTML links, it is common to use the following pseudo-classes:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>:link - Styles unvisited links</li>
        <li>:visited - Styles visited links</li>
        <li>:hover - Styles an link on mouse over</li>
        <li>:active - Styles an activated link</li>
    </ul>
