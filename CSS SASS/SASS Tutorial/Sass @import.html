    <h1>Sass @import and Partials</h1>
    <p>Sass keeps the CSS code DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself). One way to write DRY code is to keep related code in separate files.</p>

    <p>You can create small files with CSS snippets to include in other Sass files. Examples of such files can be: reset file, variables, colors, fonts, font-sizes, etc. </p>

    <h2>Sass Importing Files</h2>
    <pre>
        Just like CSS, Sass also supports the @import directive.

        The @import directive allows you to include the content of one file in another.

        The CSS @import directive has a major drawback due to performance issues; it creates an extra HTTP request each time you call it. However, the Sass @import directive includes the file in the CSS; so no extra HTTP call is required at runtime!
    </pre>

    <p>Sass Import Syntax:<br>
        @import filename;
    </p>

    <!--Tip: You do not need to specify a file extension, Sass automatically assumes that you mean a .sass or .scss file. You can also import CSS files. The @import directive imports the file and any variables or mixins defined in the imported file can then be used in the main file.-->

    <p>You can import as many files as you need in the main file:</p>

    <!--Example
@import "variables";
@import "colors";
@import "reset";-->

    <p>Let's look at an example: Let's assume we have a reset file called "reset.scss", that looks like this:</p>

    <!--Example
SCSS Syntax (reset.scss):

html,
body,
ul,
ol {
  margin: 0;
  padding: 0;
}-->
  <p>and now we want to import the "reset.scss" file into another file called "standard.scss".

Here is how we do it: It is normal to add the @import directive at the top of a file; this way its content will have a global scope:</p>

    <!--@import "reset";

body {
  font-family: Helvetica, sans-serif;
  font-size: 18px;
  color: red;
}-->

    <p>So, when the "standard.css" file is transpiled, the CSS will look like this:</p>

    <!--CSS output:

html, body, ul, ol {
  margin: 0;
  padding: 0;
}

body {
  font-family: Helvetica, sans-serif;
  font-size: 18px;
  color: red;
}-->

    <h1>Sass Partials</h1>

    <p>By default, Sass transpiles all the .scss files directly. However, when you want to import a file, you do not need the file to be transpiled directly.</p>

    <p>Sass has a mechanism for this: If you start the filename with an underscore, Sass will not transpile it. Files named this way are called partials in Sass.</p>

    <p>So, a partial Sass file is named with a leading underscore:
        Sass Partial Syntax:<br>
        _filename;
    </p>

    <p>The following example shows a partial Sass file named "_colors.scss". (This file will not be transpiled directly to "colors.css"):</p>

    <!--Example
"_colors.scss":

$myPink: #EE82EE;
$myBlue: #4169E1;
$myGreen: #8FBC8F;-->

    <p>Now, if you import the partial file, omit the underscore. Sass understands that it should import the file "_colors.scss":</p>

    <!--Example
@import "colors";

body {
  font-family: Helvetica, sans-serif;
  font-size: 18px;
  color: $myBlue;
}-->

</body>
