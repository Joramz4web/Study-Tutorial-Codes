    <h1>Sass Introduction</h1>
    <h2>What You Should Already Know</h2>

    <p>Before you continue you should have a basic understanding of the following:</p>
    <ul><li>HTML</li><li>CSS</li></ul>

    <h1>What is Sass?</h1>
    <ul>
        <li>Sass stands for Syntactically Awesome Stylesheet</li>
        <li>Sass is an extension to CSS</li>
        <li>Sass is a CSS pre-processor</li>
        <li>Sass is completely compatible with all versions of CSS</li>
        <li>Sass reduces repetition of CSS and therefore saves time</li>
        <li>Sass was designed by Hampton Catlin and developed by Natalie Weizenbaum in 2006</li>
        <li>ass is free to download and use</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Why Use Sass?</h2>
    <p>Stylesheets are getting larger, more complex, and harder to maintain. This is where a CSS pre-processor can help.</p>

    <p>Sass lets you use features that do not exist in CSS, like variables, nested rules, mixins, imports, inheritance, built-in functions, and other stuff.</p>

    <h2>A Simple Example why Sass is Useful</h2>
    <p>
        Let's say we have a website with three main colors:
        <ul>
            <li>#a2b9bc</li>
            <li>#b2ad7f</li>
            <li>#878f99</li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    <p>So, how many times do you need to type those HEX values? A LOT of times. And what about variations of the same colors?</p>
    <p>Instead of typing the above values a lot of times, you can use Sass and write this:</p>
    <!--Sass Example
/* define variables for the primary colors */
$primary_1: #a2b9bc;
$primary_2: #b2ad7f;
$primary_3: #878f99;

/* use the variables */
.main-header {
  background-color: $primary_1;
}

.menu-left {
  background-color: $primary_2;
}

.menu-right {
  background-color: $primary_3;
}-->
  <p>So, when using Sass, and the primary color changes, you only need to change it in one place.</p>
    
  <h2>How Does Sass Work?</h2>
  <p>A browser does not understand Sass code. Therefore, you will need a Sass pre-processor to convert Sass code into standard CSS.</p>

  <!--Tip: Transpiling is a term for taking a source code written in one language and transform/translate it into another language.-->

    <h2>Sass File Type</h2>
    <p>Sass files has the ".scss" file extension.</p>

    <h2>Sass Comments</h2>
    <p>Sass supports standard CSS comments /* comment */, and in addition it supports inline comments // comment:</p>

    <!--Sass Example
/* define primary colors */
$primary_1: #a2b9bc;
$primary_2: #b2ad7f;

/* use the variables */
.main-header {
  background-color: $primary_1; // here you can put an inline comment-->
