    <h1>HTML Plug-ins</h1>
    <p>Plug-ins are computer programs that extend the standard functionality of the browser.</p>

    <h2>Plug-ins</h2>
    <p>Plug-ins were designed to be used for many different purposes:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>To run Java applets</li>
        <li>To run Microsoft ActiveX controls</li>
        <li>To display Flash movies</li>
        <li>To display maps</li>
        <li>To scan for viruses</li>
        <li>To verify a bank id</li>
    </ul>

    <!--Warning !
Most browsers no longer support Java Applets and Plug-ins.
ActiveX controls are no longer supported in any browsers.
The support for Shockwave Flash has also been turned off in modern browsers.-->

    <h2>The object Element</h2>
    <p>The object element is supported by all browsers.

The object element defines an embedded object within an HTML document.<br>
It was designed to embed plug-ins (like Java applets, PDF readers, and Flash Players) in web pages, but can also be used to include HTML in HTML:</p>

    <!--Example:
    <object width="100%" height="500px" data="snippet.html"></object>
    
    Or images if you like:
    <object data="audi.jpeg"></object>-->

    <h2>The embed Element</h2>

    <p>The embed element is supported in all major browsers.

The embed element also defines an embedded object within an HTML document.
Web browsers have supported the embed element for a long time. However, it has not been a part of the HTML specification before HTML5.</p>

<!--Example
<embed src="audi.jpeg">
    Note that the <embed> element does not have a closing tag. It can not contain alternative text.-->

    <p>The embed element can also be used to include HTML in HTML:</p>
    <!--<embed width="100%" height="500px" src="snippet.html">-->
